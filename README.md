# CEAN = /kiÀên/ = Couchbase + Express + AngularJS + Node.js

This source code repository contains useful stuff regarding the subject 'Scaffolding modern JavaScript based web applications by using the C(ouchbase) + E(xpress) + A(ngularJS) + N(ode.js) stack'.

The CEAN stack is based on the following components:

* Couchbase Server: A highly scalable distributed KV-Store and Document Database System
* Express: A web application framework for Node.js
* AngularJS: A client side JavaScript MVC web application framework
* Node.js: A JavaScript oriented web service/application platform which is designed to build scalable network application

The tooling is based on:

* YEOMAN: The web's scaffolding tool for modern webapps
* cean-cli: A node module which provides a simplified command line interface on top of YEOMAN (TODO!)
