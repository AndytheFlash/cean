# A Command Line Interface for CEAN

The idea is to provide a simple command line interface for application scaffolding:

* cean init $appName

The CLI performs the following (background) tasks:

* Check if the environment is suitable
* Double check if all required components are installed
* Install the requirements by previously asking the user
